# Starting and Running Splunk

This page documents how to start Splunk after installation, log into the web interface, and verify that it is running correctly. These are the first steps a SOC analyst would take before ingesting logs or building detections.

## Step 1: Navigate to Splunk's Bin Directory
Splunk installs itself under `/opt/splunk`.

```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
```

### Verifying Splunk with `index=_internal`

The search `index=_internal` queries Splunkâ€™s own internal logs to confirm that the system is running correctly. These logs include service events, search activity, and any errors generated by Splunk. Returning results from this search verifies that Splunk is operational and ready to ingest external data sources such as Linux syslogs or Windows Event Logs.
